## Project: Finger Tracking
This project uses OpenCV library along with Numpy library to track the point of the finger. By using the HSV function, I separated out hand from the background and with the help of convexityDefects function, I track down the topmost point of the contour detected. I also added a functionality to record the tracking of the point and use it to write anything on the screen.
